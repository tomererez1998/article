Educational Reform, Ability, and Family Background
By COSTAS MEGHIR AND MÅRTEN PALME*
In the period between 1950 and the mid1970s many European countries carried out
major educational reforms that resulted in
increases in the number of compulsory years of
education, in the introduction of national curricula, and in the abolition, or delay, of the
placement of more able students into separate
schools at an early age (streaming). Examples
of such countries are the United Kingdom,
France, and the Scandinavian countries.1 Generally, it is very difficult to evaluate the impact
of such reforms, because they are implemented
nationwide simultaneously and thus evaluations
have to rely on before-and-after comparisons
which may confound the effects of the policy
with other macro-aggregate or cohort effects.2
In Sweden, major educational reform was
designed in the late 1940s. The main elements
of this reform were to (a) increase compulsory

schooling to nine years from seven or eight
years; (b) abolish placement based on academic
achievement into an academic or nonacademic
stream after grade six, i.e., at age 12 or 13; and
(c) impose a nationally unified curriculum. An
attractive feature of this reform is that it was
preceded by a social experiment, albeit not randomized, where school reform was implemented gradually across municipalities. This
permits an evaluation approach similar to those
that have been used in a number of U.S. studies,
which have examined the cross-state and crosstime variation in compulsory schooling laws
and child labor laws to estimate their impact on
educational attainment or to estimate the returns
from education.3
In this study we evaluate the effect of the
reform on final educational attainment and earnings. We have survey data on two cohorts of
pupils: those born in 1948 and those born in
1953. For a substantial portion of the municipalities, these two cohorts were assigned to different school systems: the 1948 cohort to the old
system and the 1953 cohort to the new one. In
some municipalities, however, both cohorts
were assigned to the old system, while in others
both cohorts were assigned to the new, reformed system. This allows us to evaluate the
reform using a differences-in-differences methodology, comparing outcomes across cohorts
and municipalities. The data for the two cohorts
contain information on parental background, IQ
test scores, and achievement in school (grades
by subject) in grade six. Educational attainment
and earnings are merged into the original survey
data from the national education register and the
1985–1996 tax records, respectively.
The distinctive feature of this policy experiment, combined with the data, is the ability to
compare individuals working in the same labor

market at the same point in time who attended
two different school systems. In addition, we
are able to look at heterogeneous impacts of
parental background and ability. In general, low
education of parents tends to be associated with
low educational outcomes of their children, 4
possibly because of liquidity or information
constraints or lower investments early in life.
Our data allow us to estimate the extent to
which the reform benefited those with unskilled
parents and to see the extent to which such
effects differ by ability. Thus our analysis
relates directly to key issues of policy as
expressed in James Heckman (2000) and Heckman and Alan Krueger (2004).
I. The 1950 Education Reform and the Social
Experiment

In the pre-reform school system, pupils attended a basic compulsory school (folkskolan)
until the sixth grade. Starting in seventh grade,
students with better marks were selected for the
junior secondary school (realscolan). Those
who were not admitted continued one or two
years in basic compulsory school and thereafter
could continue in full-time vocational education.5 Compulsory schooling lasted seven years;
in some municipalities, mainly in city communities, it lasted eight years. The junior secondary
school was a prerequisite for the upper secondary school, which, in turn, was a prerequisite for
higher education.
In 1948, a parliamentary committee proposed
to replace the compulsory and selective junior
secondary school with a nine-year compulsory
comprehensive school. The students would be
able to choose between three different routes
after sixth grade: one with a more academic
curriculum, one general level, and one level that
included vocational training. There would be no
selection based on grades, however, and all
pupils would attend the same schools under the

4

See, for example, Lorraine Dearden et al. (2002).
There was also a second chance of entering junior
secondary school after completing basic compulsory education. Pupils admitted to junior secondary at this later point
would, however, have to begin at the start of junior secondary, leading to a one- or two-year delay relative to the others
of the same cohort who were admitted in the first round.

new system. Finally, all schools would have the
same national curriculum.6
The proposals led to a nationwide evaluation
between 1949 and 1962, when it was decided to
implement the new school system nationally.7
In the experiment, the proposed comprehensive
school was introduced by areas, i.e., entire rural
municipalities or parts of city communities,
rather than by separate schools or classes. When
the experiment started, Sweden was divided
into about 2,500 city communities and rural
municipalities. The number of municipalities
was reduced to 1,037, however, in a reform of
the municipality system in 1952, which is the
municipal division that we use in our empirical
analysis.
The municipalities that would implement the
new system were not chosen randomly. The
National School Board, which administered the
experiment, chose them from a group of applicants to form a representative set based on municipality characteristics (see Sixten Marklund,
1981, Ch. 2). The final decision on assignment
was made by the municipality council. A
means-tested stipend was also introduced in
1953 in the reform areas to ease the perceived
financial burden of extending the years of
schooling.
New municipalities were added every year.
Students who started in the old system stayed in
that system. In 1961, at the time when the data
for the first cohort were collected (those born in
1948), about 25 percent of the municipalities
were assigned to the new system. The national
implementation took place in 1962 but the cohort from which the new school system was
implemented varied between municipalities.
Some implemented the new system for all cohorts up to those who were in fifth grade at the
time. Others, however, implemented it starting
only with the cohort of pupils who were in first
grade in 1962. This implies that in 1966, when
the data for the second cohort (born in 1953)

The reform is described in Sixten Marklund (1981) and

The official evaluation (Försöksverksamhet med
nioårig skolplikt, 1959) described in Marklund (1981) was
mainly of an administrative nature. No educational or labor
market outcomes have been considered before.

were obtained, about 30 percent of the municipalities maintained the pre-reform school system for those born in 1953. Thus, for both the
1948 and the 1953 cohorts there are both treatment (reform) and comparison (old system)
municipalities. Importantly, there is a large proportion of municipalities for which the 1948
cohort attended the old system and the 1953
cohort attended the new, reformed one.
II. Data: Measurement and Sample Selection

We use data from the 1948 and 1953 cohorts
of the Individual Statistics (IS) project of the
Institute for Education at the University of
Gothenburg.8 The 1948 and 1953 cohort surveys were obtained in the spring of 1961 and
1966, respectively, when the respondents were
in the sixth grade of compulsory school. The
same sampling strategy was used for both surveys, namely that all children born the fifth,
fifteenth, or twenty-fifth day of each month
were selected to be included in the sample. With
a rate of nonresponse for the 1948 cohort survey
of about 1.8 percent and for the 1953 cohort of
7.4 percent, the final sample sizes were 11,950
and 9,927, respectively, or about 10 percent of
the entire cohorts.
The original dataset includes information on
the educational level of each student’s parents;
results from three different IQ tests (number
series, opposites, and a test of spatial IQ referred to as folding); administrative information
on grades (Swedish, English, and mathematics);
and type of school. Thus all measures of student
ability were obtained in sixth grade. We use the
test scores to construct ability indicators included in the empirical analysis. Information on
final educational attainment was obtained from
the 1990 Swedish education register.9 Finally,
information on annual earnings and employ-

the project and the data.

We also summarize overall educational attainment using years of education. Since this is not observed directly we
impute it by assigning years of education based on the
Swedish Level of Living Survey to each of seven educational levels that we observe in the data.

MARCH 2005

ment status for each year from 1985 to 1996
was obtained from the Swedish tax registers.10
Sweden is divided administratively into 24
counties, each of which contains a number of
municipalities within commuting distance of
each other. The counties are often used to define
local labor markets (see, e.g., Olle Westerlund,
1995). Importantly, all counties but one for the
1948 cohort and all counties for the 1953 cohort
had some reform and some non-reform municipalities or parts of city communities. The number of observations in the final sample was
10,309 (5,235 men and 5,074 women) for the
1948 cohort survey and 9,007 (4,525 men and
4,482 women) for the 1953 cohort survey. For
each we observe earnings for the entire 1985–
1996 period, or a part thereof.
III. Estimating the Impact of the Reform on
Educational Qualifications and Earnings

To evaluate the impact of the reform, we
consider years of education, level of education
as measured by two binary outcomes (whether
the final completed level of education was the
new compulsory level or any other, and whether
the completed level of education was more than
the new compulsory level or any other), and log
annual earnings over the years 1985 to 1996.
The reform was carried out in entire municipalities or communities within large cities. For
the 1948 cohort, 35 percent of pupils were assigned to the new system throughout the country, based on where they lived when they were
in sixth grade. The remaining pupils were assigned to the old system. In the case of the 1953
cohort, 81 percent were assigned to the reformed system.
The sample can thus be divided into the following groups: (a) municipalities or city communities in which the 1948 cohort was not
assigned to the reform but the 1953 cohort was
(these are the municipalities that switched); (b)
municipalities in which both the 1948 and the
1953 cohorts were assigned to the reform; (c)
municipalities in which neither the 1948 nor the
1953 cohort was assigned to the reform.

10
Details of the data can be found in Meghir and Palme
(2003).

VOL. 95 NO. 1

MEGHIR AND PALME: EDUCATIONAL REFORM, ABILITY, AND FAMILY BACKGROUND

We make the following assumption: in the
absence of reform, the changes in the average
outcomes11 between the 1948 and the 1953
birth cohorts living in the municipalities that
adopted the reform would have been the same
as the changes for those living in the municipalities whose reform status remained the same
for these two cohorts— conditional, that is, on
observed characteristics. We also assume that
municipalities did not change teaching methods
or otherwise take preemptive action before they
were assigned to the reformed system. Under
these assumptions we can evaluate the impact of
the reform using differences-in-differences (Orley Ashenfelter, 1978; Heckman and Richard
Robb, 1985); that is, we compare the change in
average outcomes between the 1948 and 1953
cohorts for individuals living in the municipalities that switched when in sixth grade to the
change in average outcomes for the same cohorts of individuals living in the municipalities
that did not change status. As a robustness
check we also estimate the impacts separately
using as comparison groups either individuals
living in municipalities that implemented the
reform for both cohorts (group [b]) or individuals living in municipalities that kept the old
system for both cohorts (group [c]).12
The linear regression that implements the
differences-in-differences estimator is
(3.1)

Y idm ⫽ b 0 ⫹ b 1 d i ⫹ b⬘2 m i
⫹ ␣ridm ⫹ ␥⬘xidm ⫹ eidm

where Yidm is the relevant outcome observed for
individual i belonging to cohort d and municipality m, di is a dummy variable indicating the
cohort to which the individual belongs, and mi
is a set of dummy variables indicating the
municipality in which individual i went to
school;13 ridm is 1 for individuals belonging to a

Educational attainment and earnings.
In a few municipalities, because of boundary changes,
some individuals end up being assigned to the reform and
others not. We retain these observations.

For pupils educated in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and
Malmo, we are not able to include fixed effects for the
particular community in which they live. However, we
include dummies for each of these cities.

cohort and municipality assigned to the reformed system. The parameter ␣ is the average
effect of the reform for those assigned to it
among the population from which the sample is
drawn.14 The variables xidm reflect the observable characteristics of individual students. Finally eidm represents a random error term
assumed uncorrelated with ridm conditional on
the other regressors, i.e., we assume that
E(eidm 兩ridm, di, mi, xidm) ⫽ E(eidm兩 di, mi, xidm).
The additive municipality (m) and cohort effects (d) in (3.1), together with the stated properties of the error term, reflect the assumptions
underlying the differences-in-differences approach, as stated above.
For log earnings and years of education, we
use ordinary least squares (OLS) on (3.1). For
the discrete educational outcomes we use a probit model. This requires the additional assumption that eidm is normal conditional on ridm, di,
mi, and xidm. However, a linear probability
model gives almost identical results. In all cases
the covariates x include indicators for test scores
and school grades obtained when the pupils
were in sixth grade and for the country of
work.15 When we present results pooled across
males and females we include a gender dummy
on its own and interacted with all x’s. Since for
each individual we have repeated earnings observations over the period 1985–1996, we also
include time dummies for these years in the
earnings regressions. Thus we effectively compare the earnings of individuals within the same
local labor market and year.
In computing the standard errors we allow for
arbitrary municipality level spatial correlation
and, in the case of earnings where we have
multiple observations over time, for arbitrary
serial correlation as well.16
Table A1 in the Appendix presents descriptive statistics and reports the difference in some
characteristics between individuals living in

14
So, for example, when we estimate using the pooled
sample of males and females with unskilled fathers, the
effect is the average effect over that population.
15
The test scores include three IQ tests as shown in
Table A1 in the Appendix, and student grades in Swedish,
English, and mathematics.

switching and nonswitching municipalities.
These differences are not significant, implying
there would be no bias if we excluded these
covariates from the regression. We still include
the covariates, however, to improve estimated
precision, because they are highly correlated
with both educational attainment and earnings.
A reform of this magnitude may have had
aggregate effects on the labor market, including
on the price of labor. However, since we compare workers within the same labor markets our
estimates do not include such effects.17 They
reflect the relative merits of the two school
systems given the overall macroeconomic
conditions.
IV. Results

A. The Effect of the Reform on Education
The estimates of the impact of the reform on
education are shown in Table 1. These are presented for the whole sample and by gender. We
also break them down by father’s education
(low and high)18 and ability (low and high).19
We refer to fathers with low education as unskilled fathers. For years of education we report
the OLS estimate of ␣ from equation (3.1)
which represents the effect of the reform measured in years of education. For the educational
levels the estimates are the marginal effects of
the reform from a probit model, based on (3.1),
multiplied by 100 to transform them to percentage point effects on the probability of attaining
the level in question.
The average effect of the reform for men and
women was to increase the proportion attending
through to the new compulsory level by 8.5
percentage points, and beyond that level by 2.6
percentage points, showing that the reform had
17

See Kevin Lang and David Kropp (1986).
We classify as unskilled or low-education fathers both
those who received just the statutory level of education and
those whose educational classification is missing from the
data.
19
To define the ability groups we take the average IQ
score across three different IQ tests for each person and
classify individuals with scores above the sample median as
high ability. For the cases where we do not have IQ test
scores we base our classification on average school grade at
the same age.

an impact beyond the new compulsory level;
this is consistent with the aim of the reform to
improve access to higher levels of education.
All changes in educational attainment taken
together translate into an increase in years of
education by 0.298 of a year. These effects are
highly significant. The entire effect is due to the
increase in the educational attainment of those
with unskilled fathers (column 2). Within that
group, those with low ability increased their
attainment by moving up to the new compulsory level with an almost equal drop in the
proportion attending the former compulsory
level. For those of higher ability, however, the
increase in attainment is reinforced by a large
increase beyond the new compulsory level (column 4). Thus it seems that the measures for
improving access beyond the new compulsory
level had an important impact for the more able
students with unskilled fathers.
Table 1 also breaks down the effect by men
and women. The main difference revealed here
is that the increase beyond the new compulsory
level is stronger for women.
B. The Effect of the Reform on Earnings
We estimate the impact of the reform on
average annual log-pre-tax earnings for both
men and women, with positive earnings for all
or part of the years in the 1985–1996 period for
which earnings are observed.20 We report the
OLS estimate of ␣ from equation (3.1) multiplied by 100, so that the reported effects can be
interpreted as the percent effects on earnings
averaged over the observation period. The results are shown in Table 2.
The overall effect of the reform on earnings
at 1.42 percent was small and only significant at
the 10.9-percent level. However, this conceals
substantial heterogeneity in the effects for different groups of individuals. For those with
unskilled fathers the reform increased earnings
by 3.4 percent, which is highly significant. In
terms of the point estimates, the effect is larger
for the high-ability individuals but the difference is not significant. The difference between

20
There was no effect of the reform on the proportion of
individuals with positive earnings.

women and has a p-value of 5 percent; this is
consistent with the fact that the reform had a

higher-ability women than men of the corresponding group, but about the same for lowability men and women.
One of the striking results (which explains
the small overall effect) is the negative impact
(⫺5.6 percent) on the earnings of individuals
with skilled fathers, who constitute 17 percent

of the population. This is true for both males
and females, despite the fact that there is no
significant change in educational attainment for
the group. These individuals used to attend primarily the academic junior secondary school,
which selected students on the basis of level of
attainment in sixth grade. The reform abolished
this selection and it seems that this reduced the
quality of education and ultimately the earnings
of this group.
Finally, since both the amount of education

and the quality/type of education changed for
individuals of all abilities among those with
unskilled fathers, it is not possible to say which
aspect of the reform led to the earnings gains. If
all the earnings changes were due to changes in
the quantity of education, this would correspond
to a return to education of 5.6 percent for the
low-ability individuals and 12.8 percent for the
high-ability ones (8.4 percent overall); if one
accepts that the other changes enhanced earnings for this group by improving the quality of
education, these will be upper bounds to the
effects of education on earnings. As a benchmark for the magnitude of these effects, note
that Anders Björklund (2000) estimated the
wage premium per additional year of education
to be 4.6 percent for Sweden.
When we break down the effects by gender
we note that the effects for individuals with
unskilled fathers are higher for women than
men, but both are significant. For men we cannot
distinguish much of a difference between those of
high and low ability; however, for high-ability
women the effect is larger than for lower-ability
women, and the difference is significant.21

21
The presence of municipality cluster effects implies
that the estimates are correlated across subsamples. We used

MARCH 2005

Did the reform affect earnings growth or was
the effect uniform over the life cycle? Figure 1 shows log real earnings over time for all
males and females whose fathers have a low
level of education. In the left-hand panel we
present the log earnings for those born in 1948
for the years 1985–1996. We have split the
sample depending on which type of municipality individuals live in: the line with circles relates to those living in municipalities that had
not implemented the reform and will still not
implement it for the 1953 cohort (the never
treated). The line with squares relates to those
living in municipalities that had already implemented the reform for the 1948 cohort and also
for the 1953 cohort (the always treated). Finally
the line with triangles relates to those living
in municipalities that had not implemented
the reform for the 1948 cohort but did implement it for the 1953 cohort (the switching
municipalities).
Comparing the never treated graph to the one
for the switchers we can see that there are no
significant systematic differences between the
two groups for the 1948 cohort. We expect the
graph for the always treated to be higher since
this reflects the effect of the reform. The graph
for the switching municipalities, relative to the
never treated once the reform is implemented
for the 1953 cohort, reflects the impact of the
reform. This is shown in the right-hand panel
where the earnings for the 1953 cohort are indicated. The graph for those in the switching
municipalities has now moved up and overlaps
with that for those in the always treated group,
reflecting the impact of the reform. The graph
seems also to suggest that the reform had a
positive effect on earnings growth; however, we
find this difference to be insignificant once we
apply the differences-in-differences estimator
for growth of earnings over time.
Sensitivity Analysis.—In Table 3 we present
the results of some sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness of the results. For the sake of
brevity we present only the average effects across
males and females split by father’s education,

the block bootstrap and obtained a p-value for the difference
of zero.

which seems to be the most important source of
heterogeneity for the impact on earnings.
We reestimated the model using first, as controls, individuals living in municipalities that
implemented the reform for both cohorts (column 1, Table 3) and then using as controls
individuals living in municipalities that kept the
old system for both cohorts. As can be seen in

Table 3, the results are remarkably similar to
those presented in Table 2, which uses both
comparison groups.
In column 3 we show results when excluding

effects are very similar to those reported in
Table 2.
Finally, we estimated the effects using propensity score matching based on the 1948 cohort only. These estimates do not control for
unobserved municipality characteristics but do
not rely on additive (in logs) cohort effects since
we compare only within cohort. The results,
reported in detail in Meghir and Palme (2003),
are less precise but display very similar
patterns.
Selective Mobility and the Impact of the Reform.—Families may have moved residences to
choose suitable schooling for their children. We
use the municipality of birth to assess the extent
to which this may have affected the results we
report. For some individuals it is not possible to
know whether they would have been in the
reform or not on the basis of their place of birth,
mainly because the municipality borders were
adjusted after the birth of our cohorts. Overall
we were able to classify 87.3 percent of the
sample. Of these, 90.1 percent did not change
reform status from that indicated by place of
birth. Of the 9.9 percent who we know changed
status, 5.3 percent moved from a reform to a
nonreform municipality and 4.6 percent moved
in the other direction. Further details on this for
the 1948 cohort are given in Meghir and Palme
(2003).
We can use the birth municipality in two
ways. First we reestimate the model only for
those who did not change status as a result of
moving out of the municipality of their birth.
The results are shown in column 4 of Table 3 and they are not significantly different
from those in Table 2. Based on a Hausman
test,22 for those with unskilled fathers the difference has a t-value of 0.47. For those whose
fathers have a higher level of education, we still
22
The rationale for carrying out a Hausman test is as
follows: (a) under the null hypothesis that movers are randomly selected, the estimation based on non-movers estimates only the same parameter but is inefficient relative to
using the entire sample; (b) under the alternative, the estimates based on each of the samples will converge asymptotically to different points in the parameter space providing
power to the test, because the samples are selected endogenously, but each in a different way.

get a negative effect but smaller in absolute
value. The t-statistic for the difference from the
estimate in Table 2 is 1.14, which is not significant at the 5-percent level.
We also reestimated the model using instrumental variables, treating reform allocation as
endogenous even conditional on the observables and the municipality fixed effects. The
instruments are (a) whether we know the reform
status or not based on the birth municipality;
and (b) if we know the reform status, whether it
is reform or non-reform. The instruments are
highly significant with a p-value of zero, both
overall and for the two subsamples of higher
and lower education of the father. For those
with unskilled fathers the point estimate is almost the same (column 5). For those with
skilled fathers, however, the IV estimator is too
imprecise, although it is still negative as in all
other cases.23 Thus there is no strong evidence
that mobility is a source of bias for these results.
V. Conclusion

The reform of the Swedish education system
had important effects on the educational attainment and earnings of individuals. We establish
a large increase in the share of students reaching
the new compulsory level for the group with
unskilled fathers and low ability. More interestingly, the reform led to an increase in schooling
beyond the new compulsory level for individuals with higher ability and unskilled fathers.
This may have helped increase intergenerational mobility by improving access beyond the
new compulsory level. We also find that labor
market earnings increased significantly for individuals with unskilled fathers; there are also
indications, however, that earnings fell for individuals with higher-skilled fathers, indicating
that the abolition of selection may have reduced
the quality of education obtained by this group.
Nevertheless, the reform improved on average
both the educational attainment and the earnings of a large part of the population.
23
This is because of the combination of the limited
mobility and the inability to classify a substantial number of
individuals to reform/non-reform status using the municipality of birth.
